Always use the latest documentation for imports and packages.  

Use fetch tool if you know the url of the docs.

Use Tavily MCP Search and Extract to research documentation and examples when trying to make things work.

For how to write an mcp server in Python see https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk

For python projects always use astral uv; e.g. 'uv run', 'uv add', 'uv sync' etc.  DO NOT USE `python` or `python3` commands directly.
